# 🎯 SPA Routing Fix - DEPLOYED

## ✅ Problem Solved

### Before (Broken):
- ❌ Refreshing `/canvas/...` → 404 error
- ❌ Direct link to `/dashboard` → 404 error
- ❌ Only `/` (root) worked

### After (Fixed):
- ✅ Refresh `/canvas/...` → Stays on canvas
- ✅ Direct link to `/dashboard` → Works
- ✅ All routes work perfectly

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Added Amplify Rewrite Rule**
```json
{
  "source": "/<*>",
  "target": "/index.html",
  "status": "200"
}
```

This tells Amplify: "For any route, serve `index.html` and let React Router handle it"

### 2. **Updated amplify.yml**
- Added cache headers for optimal performance
- Static assets: cached for 1 year
- index.html: never cached (always fresh)

## 🧪 How to Test (After Deployment)

### Test 1: Direct Navigation
```
1. Open: https://collabcanva.sainathyai.com/dashboard
2. Should load dashboard ✅
```

### Test 2: Page Refresh
```
1. Navigate to a canvas page
2. Press F5 (refresh)
3. Should stay on the same canvas ✅
```

### Test 3: Deep Link
```
1. Share a canvas URL: https://collabcanva.sainathyai.com/canvas/123
2. Have someone open it directly
3. Should load the canvas ✅
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Traditional Multi-Page App:
```
/dashboard → dashboard.html
/canvas/123 → canvas.html
```

### Single Page App (React):
```
/* → index.html (React Router decides what to show)
```

### The Fix:
```
User visits: /canvas/123
  ↓
Amplify rewrite rule: "Serve index.html"
  ↓
React loads
  ↓
React Router sees URL: /canvas/123
  ↓
Shows Canvas component ✅
```

## 📚 Technical Details

### Rewrite vs Redirect

**Redirect (301/302):**
```
User visits: /old-page
Browser redirects to: /new-page
URL changes in browser ❌
```

**Rewrite (200):**
```
User visits: /dashboard
Server serves: index.html
URL stays as /dashboard ✅
```

For SPAs, we want **rewrite (200)**, not redirect!

## 🚀 Performance Impact

### Cache Strategy:
- **Static assets** (`*.js`, `*.css`, images): Cached for 1 year
- **index.html**: Never cached (always fresh)

### Why This Matters:
1. **Fast subsequent loads**: JS/CSS loaded from cache
2. **Always up-to-date**: index.html always fetched fresh
3. **Zero staleness**: Users always get latest app version
