# Product Context: CollabCanvas

## Why This Exists
CollabCanvas is a learning project demonstrating real-time collaborative editing capabilities. It serves as a portfolio piece and technical proof-of-concept for building multiplayer web applications.

## Problems It Solves

### User Problems
1. **Learning Real-Time Collaboration**: Developers need practical examples of building collaborative applications
2. **Understanding WebSocket**: Need hands-on experience with WebSocket for bidirectional communication
3. **Presence Awareness**: Users want to see who else is active and where they're working

### Technical Problems
1. **State Synchronization**: How to keep multiple clients in sync without conflicts
2. **Real-Time Communication**: Implementing efficient WebSocket-based communication
3. **Authentication with WebSocket**: Securing WebSocket connections with token-based auth
4. **Deployment Complexity**: Getting real-time apps deployed on free tier hosting

## How It Works

### User Flow
```
1. User visits https://collab-canva-jdte.vercel.app
2. Clicks "Sign in with Google"
3. Authenticates via Firebase (Google OAuth)
4. Redirected to /canvas
5. WebSocket connection established automatically
6. User sees:
   - Empty canvas or existing objects
   - Other users' cursors with names
   - Header with their own display name
7. User can:
   - Click "Add Rectangle" to create new object
   - Click and drag objects to move them
   - Press Delete key to remove selected object
   - See all actions sync in real-time
```

### Collaboration Experience
- **Instant Feedback**: When User A adds a rectangle, User B sees it appear within 100ms
- **Cursor Awareness**: Users see colorful cursors showing where others are pointing
- **Name Labels**: Each cursor displays the user's name from Google account
- **Smooth Interaction**: Cursor positions throttled to 60 updates/sec for smooth movement
- **Seamless Reconnection**: If connection drops, automatic reconnection attempts

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Immediate Collaboration**: No setup required - sign in and start collaborating
2. **Clear Presence**: Always know who else is on the canvas
3. **Responsive Actions**: Actions feel instant and synchronized
4. **No Confusion**: Clear visual feedback for all interactions

### Design Decisions
- **Single Canvas**: Simplified scope - everyone shares one canvas (no rooms/channels)
- **Rectangles Only**: Focus on synchronization mechanics, not drawing features
- **Minimal UI**: Clean interface - toolbar, canvas, header with user name
- **Color-Coded Cursors**: Each user gets a unique color for easy identification
- **In-Memory State**: Fast and simple - no database overhead for MVP

### Non-Goals (Intentional Limitations)
- **Not Persistent**: Canvas resets when last user leaves (acceptable for MVP)
- **Not Mobile-Optimized**: Desktop-focused experience
- **No Chat**: Focus on visual collaboration only
- **No Access Control**: Single public canvas, no permissions system
- **No History**: No undo/redo or version control

## Key Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First-Time User
```
User opens app → Signs in with Google → Sees empty canvas → 
Adds first rectangle → Feels accomplished
```

### Scenario 2: Joining Active Session
```
User opens app → Signs in → Canvas already has objects → 
Sees another user's cursor moving → Adds their own rectangle → 
Watches it sync to other user → Feels connected
```

### Scenario 3: Collaborative Creation
```
User A adds rectangle in top-left → User B adds rectangle in bottom-right → 
User A drags theirs down → User B drags theirs up → 
They create a pattern together → Demonstrates real-time collaboration
```

### Scenario 4: Connection Issues
```
User's network drops → "Reconnecting..." shown → 
Connection restored → Canvas state syncs → 
User continues working seamlessly
```

## Feature Prioritization Philosophy

### Implemented (PR1-10)
**Principle**: Build comprehensive platform BEFORE AI  
**Rationale**: AI needs rich features to manipulate. A canvas with 12 shapes is more impressive than one with 2 shapes + AI.

**Result**: 
- 85/100 points secured
- Professional-grade canvas
- AI can do more interesting things

### Deferred Features
**Principle**: Focus on what scores points  
**Rationale**: Some features are production-nice-to-haves but don't directly contribute to grading.

**Deferred Items**:
1. **Conflict Resolution**: Important for production, but scoring uncertain
   - Options considered: Last-write-wins, object locking, notification system
   - Decision: Defer until after 100/100 achieved
   
2. **Database Persistence**: Required for production, but no rubric points
   - Would enable canvas save/load
   - Would enable multiple canvases
   - Decision: Defer until after AI

3. **AWS Deployment**: Better than current Render/Vercel, but functional now
   - EC2 + Redis + DynamoDB
   - No cold starts
   - Decision: Defer until after AI

4. **Undo/Redo**: Nice UX feature, but not in rubric
   - Standard expectation
   - Complex to implement correctly
   - Decision: Defer until after AI

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### Why Individual Selection Boxes?
**Decision**: Each selected shape shows its own dashed blue border  
**Alternatives Considered**: Single bounding box around all selected  
**Rationale**: 
- Users can see exactly what's selected
- Independent transforms per shape (while still moving as group)
- Follows Figma/Sketch/Miro patterns
- Better visual feedback

### Why Dashed Light Blue?
**Decision**: #66B3FF, dashed (5px dash, 5px gap)  
**Alternatives Considered**: Solid dark blue (#0066FF)  
**Rationale**:
- Softer, less intrusive
- Easier on eyes during extended use
- Distinguishes from object content
- Modern design aesthetic

### Why Space for Pan?
**Decision**: Hold Space, drag to move canvas  
**Alternatives Considered**: Middle mouse button, Ctrl+drag  
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard (Figma, Miro, Photoshop)
- Muscle memory from other tools
- Space is easily accessible
- Doesn't conflict with selection

### Why 12 Shapes Specifically?
**Decision**: Rectangle, Circle, Text, Line, Triangle, Star, Hexagon, Arrow, Ellipse, Rounded Rect, Diamond, Pentagon  
**Alternatives Considered**: 8 shapes (stop at Arrow), 20+ shapes  
**Rationale**:
- Covers most common use cases
- Ellipse & Rounded Rect are essential (not in MVP)
- Pentagon fills polygon family (3,4,5,6 sides)
- Diamond useful for flowcharts
- 12 feels complete without overwhelming

### Why Konva.js Over Native Canvas?
**Decision**: Use Konva.js framework  
**Alternatives Considered**: Stay with HTML5 Canvas API  
**Rationale**:
- Built-in transform controls (resize, rotate)
- Event handling out of the box
- Layer management
- Better performance
- Less code to maintain

## User Journey: From MVP to Production

### Week 1 User (MVP)
```
User signs in → Sees empty canvas → 
"I can add rectangles and move them" → 
"Cool, it syncs!" → 
Limited by single shape type
```

### Week 2 User (PR10)
```
User signs in → Sees toolbar with 12 shapes → 
"Wow, lots of options!" → 
Creates circle, triangle, star → 
Uses Ctrl+C/V to duplicate → 
Zooms in to see detail → 
"This feels like a real tool!"
```

### Week 3 User (PR15 - After AI)
```
User signs in → Opens AI chat → 
Types "create a star pattern" → 
AI creates 5 stars arranged in circle → 
User says "make them bigger" → 
AI resizes all → 
"This is magical!"
```

## Conflict Resolution Discussion

### Problem Statement
When 2 users edit the same object simultaneously, which change wins?

**Example Scenario**:
```
10:00:00.000 - User A moves circle to (100, 100)
10:00:00.050 - User B moves same circle to (200, 200)
→ Which position should the circle end up at?
```

### Current Behavior (No Conflict Resolution)
- **Last message received wins**
- No detection of conflicts
- No user notification
- Works fine with 2-5 users (rare conflicts)
- Could cause confusion with 10+ simultaneous users

### Options Considered

**Option 1: Last-Write-Wins (Simple)**
- Compare timestamps
- Most recent wins
- Show visual warning if conflict detected
- **Pros**: Simple, no data loss prevention needed
- **Cons**: Silently loses earlier change
- **Effort**: 30 minutes
- **Use Case**: Low-conflict scenarios (current state)

**Option 2: Object Locking**
- Lock object when user starts editing
- Show lock icon on locked objects
- Other users can't edit until unlocked
- **Pros**: Prevents conflicts entirely
- **Cons**: UX friction, can feel limiting
- **Effort**: 1 hour
- **Use Case**: High-conflict, structured workflows

**Option 3: Conflict Notification**
- Detect conflicts (timestamp + user comparison)
- Show visual warning to both users
- Let users manually resolve (keep mine/keep theirs/merge)
- **Pros**: User stays in control, no data loss
- **Cons**: Interrupts workflow
- **Effort**: 2 hours
- **Use Case**: Balanced approach for production

**Option 4: Operational Transformation (Complex)**
- Algorithmically merge conflicting operations
- Similar to Google Docs
- No data loss, seamless resolution
- **Pros**: Best UX, truly collaborative
- **Cons**: Very complex (10+ hours), hard to debug
- **Effort**: 10+ hours
- **Use Case**: Production-critical systems

### Decision: Defer Until After AI
**Rationale**:
- Current system works fine for target user count (2-5 users)
- AI features worth 15 guaranteed points
- Conflict resolution is bonus/polish (uncertain scoring)
- Can add later if time permits

**When to Revisit**:
- After reaching 100/100
- If planning to scale to 10+ concurrent users
- If demo reveals frequent conflicts
- If adding to portfolio as production feature
