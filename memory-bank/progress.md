## What's Left to Build

### Immediate (PR9)
- [ ] Push `pr9-smoke-tests-and-fixes` branch
- [ ] Create final PR on GitHub
- [ ] Merge PR9 to main
- [ ] **Project officially complete!** 🎉

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
None required for MVP, but could add:

#### Polish
- Loading states and spinners
- Better error messages
- Toast notifications
- Improved visual design
- Mobile responsiveness

#### Features
- More shapes: circles, lines, text, images
- Color picker for objects
- Undo/redo functionality
- Canvas persistence (save to database)
- Multiple canvas rooms/sessions
- Access control and permissions
- Export canvas to PNG/SVG
- Chat alongside canvas

#### Technical Improvements
- Unit test coverage (currently minimal)
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Performance optimizations (partial canvas redraws)
- Service worker for offline support
- Conflict resolution (CRDT or OT)
- Redis for multi-instance support
- Sentry for error tracking
- Analytics for usage insights

## Known Issues

### Production Issues
**None!** All critical issues resolved.

### Known Limitations (By Design)
1. **In-Memory State**: Canvas resets when server restarts (acceptable for MVP)
2. **Cold Starts**: Render free tier sleeps after 15 min inactivity (~30-60s startup)
3. **Single Canvas**: All users share one canvas (no rooms feature)
4. **No Persistence**: Objects lost if all users disconnect (acceptable for MVP)
5. **No Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins for simultaneous edits (rare with low user count)
6. **Token Expiration**: Firebase tokens expire after 1 hour (user must refresh page)

### Workarounds in Place
- **Cold Starts**: Client shows "Connecting..." and auto-retries
- **Disconnections**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **State Sync**: Full state sent to new clients on connection

---
