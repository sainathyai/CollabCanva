**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025

## Current Status
ðŸŽ¯ **PRIORITY: PR11 - AI CANVAS AGENT**

MVP (PR1-PR9) and PR10 (Konva + Advanced Features) are complete. Currently prioritizing PR11 (AI Features) to reach 100/100 points.

## Recent Changes (Most Recent First)

### Strategy Update: Reorganized PR Sequence
- **Date**: October 16, 2025
- **Change**: Reprioritized AI features from PR15 to PR11

  - Implemented rotation and scaling transformations
  - Added multi-selection with Shift+click
  - Implemented area selection (drag to select multiple)
  - Added individual transformers for each selected shape
  - Enhanced toolbar with visual icons for all shapes

9. **PR9**: Smoke tests and final documentation

## Current Branch
`pr10-konva-transforms` (ready to merge)

**Next Branch**: `pr11-ai-canvas-agent` (to be created)

## Working State

### Production URLs
- **Frontend**: https://collab-canva-jdte.vercel.app
- **Backend**: https://collabcanva-backend.onrender.com
- **Repository**: https://github.com/sainathyai/CollabCanva

### MVP Features (All Working) âœ…
- Firebase Google OAuth authentication
- Real-time object synchronization (add, move, delete, transform)
- Live cursors with user name labels
- Multiple concurrent users supported
- WebSocket reconnection handling
- Smooth cursor updates (throttled to 60 FPS)

### New Features in PR10 âœ¨
- **Konva Canvas**: Professional canvas library for better rendering
- **12+ Shape Types**: Rectangle, circle, text, line, triangle, star, polygon, arrow, ellipse, rounded rectangle, diamond, pentagon
- **Transformations**: Rotate and scale objects with visual handles
- **Multi-Selection**: Shift+click or drag area to select multiple objects
- **Group Operations**: Move, delete, duplicate, or color-change multiple objects at once
- **Canvas Controls**: Zoom in/out with mouse wheel, pan by holding Space
- **Clipboard**: Copy (Ctrl+C), paste (Ctrl+V), duplicate (Ctrl+D)
- **Color Picker**: Change colors of selected objects
- **Enhanced Toolbar**: Visual icons for all tools

## Next Steps

### Immediate: PR11 - AI Canvas Agent (PRIORITY)
- Install OpenAI package and get API key
- Define 6+ AI function types for canvas operations
- Create AI service with function calling
- Build chat UI component (sidebar)
- Integrate with Canvas.tsx
- Test all command types with multi-user sync
- **Goal**: Add 15 points â†’ 100/100

### After Reaching 100/100
If user wants to continue:

1. **Polish**:
   - Better loading states and animations
   - Improved error messages and user feedback
   - Mobile responsiveness and touch support
   - Better visual design and theming

2. **Features**:
   - Free-hand drawing with pen tool
   - Image upload and embedding
   - Canvas persistence (save to database)
   - Multiple canvas rooms
   - Export to PNG/SVG
   - Undo/redo with history

3. **Technical**:
   - Unit test coverage for new features
   - E2E tests with Playwright
   - Performance optimizations (only redraw changed objects)
   - Upgrade to paid hosting (no cold starts)
   - Add Redis for multi-instance support

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Decision: Add Konva for Professional Canvas Rendering
**Rationale**: Vanilla Canvas API is limited for complex interactions. Konva provides:
- Built-in transformers (rotation, scaling)
- Better event handling for shapes
- Easier multi-selection and grouping
- Professional-grade canvas features

**Trade-off**: Added ~100KB to bundle size, but worth it for UX improvements

### Decision: Support Multiple Shape Types
**Rationale**: MVP only had rectangles. Adding 12+ shapes makes the app more useful and demonstrates the architecture's flexibility. All shapes sync properly via existing WebSocket protocol.

### Decision: Keep Backward Compatibility
**Rationale**: Existing `CanvasObject` interface extended with new fields (rotation, zIndex) but remains compatible with old objects. Backend doesn't need major changes - just passes through the new properties.

### Consideration: Memory Bank Updated
**Action Taken**: Updating comprehensive Memory Bank structure to reflect PR10 changes so future sessions understand the current state.

## Known Issues

### PR10 Specific
- Need to test that new shape types sync properly across clients
- Need to verify rotation and scaling values are preserved during transforms
- Multi-selection with group drag needs testing across WebSocket
- Color picker needs to broadcast changes to other users

### Production Issues (From MVP)
None! All critical issues from MVP resolved.

### Known Limitations (By Design)
1. **In-Memory State**: Canvas resets when server restarts (acceptable for MVP)
2. **Cold Starts**: Render free tier sleeps after 15 min inactivity (~30-60s startup)
3. **Single Canvas**: All users share one canvas (no rooms feature)
4. **No Persistence**: Objects lost if all users disconnect (acceptable for MVP)
5. **No Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins for simultaneous edits

## Communication Context

### User Preferences (Observed)
- Prefers hands-on development and testing
- Values working features over documentation
- Comfortable with Git, terminal commands
- Works iteratively - build features, test, refine
- Wants clear, actionable next steps

### Session Context
- This session: User asked to refresh context from memory bank
- Previous context: MVP was complete (PR9), but user has since worked on PR10
- Current state: PR10 is in progress with significant enhancements
- Goal: Update memory bank to reflect current reality

## Quick Reference

### Local Development
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev  # http://localhost:5173

# Backend
cd backend && npm run dev   # ws://localhost:8080

# Both use .env files (not committed, see .env.example)
```

### Deploy Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "description"
git push origin pr10-konva-transforms  # Push current branch
# After testing, merge to main for auto-deploy
```

### View Logs
- **Frontend**: Vercel dashboard > Deployments > Logs
- **Backend**: Render dashboard > collabcanva-backend > Logs
- **Local Frontend**: Browser console (F12)
- **Local Backend**: Terminal where `npm run dev` is running

### Test Features
1. Open https://collab-canva-jdte.vercel.app in 2 browsers
2. Sign in with different Google accounts
3. Test shape creation, transformation, multi-selection
4. Verify all actions sync in real-time
5. Test keyboard shortcuts and canvas controls

## Context for Next Session

If I (Cursor AI) return to this project after a memory reset:

1. **Read ALL Memory Bank files first** - this is critical
2. **Check current branch**: Should be `pr10-konva-transforms`
3. **Check git status**: `git status`
4. **Review recent commits**: `git log --oneline -10`
5. **Ask user what they want to work on**
6. **Consult `progress.md`** for detailed completion status

### Project Status
- MVP (PR1-PR9) complete and deployed âœ…
- PR10 (Konva transforms) in progress ðŸš§
- Branch: `pr10-konva-transforms`
- Ready for testing and refinement
