## Current Branch
`pr9-smoke-tests-and-fixes` (off of `main`)

## Working State

### Production URLs
- **Frontend**: https://collab-canva-jdte.vercel.app
- **Backend**: https://collabcanva-backend.onrender.com
- **Repository**: https://github.com/sainathyai/CollabCanva

### All Features Working âœ…
- Firebase Google OAuth authentication
- Real-time object synchronization (add, move, delete)
- Live cursors with user name labels
- Multiple concurrent users supported
- WebSocket reconnection handling
- Smooth cursor updates (throttled to 60 FPS)

### Recent Fixes Applied
1. **Frontend TypeScript Errors**:
   - Added `MessageType.PRESENCE_JOIN`, `PRESENCE_CURSOR`, `PRESENCE_LEAVE` to enum
   - Fixed unused variable `hasReceivedInitialState`
   - Added explicit type to `forEach((p: Presence) => ...)`
   - Used MessageType enum instead of string literals

2. **Backend TypeScript Errors**:
   - Removed extra argument from `verifyToken(message.token)` call
   - Fixed error handler types: `(error: Error) =>`
   - Updated `tsconfig.json` to allow `@types/ws`
   - Fixed `render.yaml` build command to include devDependencies

3. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Render: `buildCommand: npm ci --include=dev && npm run build`
   - Render: `startCommand: NODE_ENV=production node dist/server.js`
   - Vercel: `installCommand: npm install`
   - Fixed Firebase authorized domains
   - Configured CORS for production origin

## Next Steps

### Immediate: Merge PR9 and Complete Project
```bash
git push origin pr9-smoke-tests-and-fixes
# Create PR on GitHub
# Merge to main
# Project officially complete! ðŸŽ‰
```

### Optional Future Enhancements
If user wants to continue beyond MVP:

1. **Polish**:
   - Better loading states
   - Improved error messages
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Better visual design

2. **Features**:
   - More shapes (circles, lines, text)
   - Color picker for objects
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - Canvas persistence (database)
   - Multiple canvas rooms
   - Export to PNG/SVG

3. **Technical**:
   - Unit test coverage
   - E2E tests with Playwright
   - Performance optimizations
   - Upgrade to paid hosting (no cold starts)
   - Add Redis for multi-instance support

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Decision: Document Everything Now
**Rationale**: Project is complete and working - perfect time to create Memory Bank before moving on. This ensures any future work can pick up seamlessly.

### Decision: Keep PR9 Simple
**Rationale**: Core work is done. PR9 is just documentation and smoke test validation. No code changes needed unless bugs discovered.

### Consideration: Memory Bank Created
**Action Taken**: Creating comprehensive Memory Bank structure so future sessions can understand the entire project:
- projectbrief.md (requirements and scope)
- productContext.md (why and how)
- systemPatterns.md (architecture and patterns)
- techContext.md (technologies and setup)
- activeContext.md (this file - current state)
- progress.md (what's done and what's left)

## Known Issues
None! All major issues resolved during deployment:
- âœ… TypeScript compilation errors - fixed
- âœ… Render cold starts - documented, acceptable for free tier
- âœ… Firebase auth integration - working
- âœ… CORS configuration - correct
- âœ… WebSocket connection - stable
- âœ… Cursor visibility - working between users

## Environment Notes

### Current Working Environment
- **Machine**: Mac (developer's primary machine)
- **Node Version**: 18 (specified in .nvmrc)
- **Git Branch**: `pr9-smoke-tests-and-fixes`
- **Git Status**: Clean (just committed documentation)

### Deployment Status
- **Vercel**: Auto-deploys from `main` branch âœ…
- **Render**: Auto-deploys from `main` branch âœ…
- **Firebase**: Authorized domains configured âœ…

### Access
- User has full access to:
  - GitHub repository (push access)
  - Vercel dashboard (deployment control)
  - Render dashboard (backend control)
  - Firebase console (auth management)

## Files Recently Modified
1. `DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` (created)
2. `docs/SMOKE_TEST.md` (updated with URLs)
3. `frontend/src/lib/ws.ts` (added presence message types)
4. `frontend/src/pages/Canvas.tsx` (fixed TypeScript errors)
5. `backend/src/ws/handlers.ts` (fixed verifyToken call)
6. `backend/render.yaml` (fixed build/start commands)

## Communication Context

### User Preferences (Observed)
- Prefers hands-on deployment and testing
- Values working software over documentation (but appreciates good docs)
- Comfortable with Git, terminal commands
- Works iteratively - fix errors as they come
- Wants clear, actionable instructions

### Session Context
- This session: Started with PR8 deployment issues, worked through to successful deployment, now documenting with PR9 and Memory Bank
- User confirmed app is working with concurrent cursors
- User expressed desire to merge everything to main and deploy main branch (done)
- User now interested in what's next (PR9) and we're formalizing documentation

## Quick Reference

### Local Development
```bash
# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev  # http://localhost:5173

# Backend  
cd backend && npm run dev   # ws://localhost:8080

# Both use .env files (not committed, see .env.example)
```

### Deploy Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "description"
git push origin main  # Triggers auto-deploy on both platforms
```

### View Logs
- **Frontend**: Vercel dashboard > Deployments > Logs
- **Backend**: Render dashboard > collabcanva-backend > Logs
- **Local Frontend**: Browser console (F12)
- **Local Backend**: Terminal where `npm run dev` is running

### Test Deployment
1. Open https://collab-canva-jdte.vercel.app in 2 browsers
2. Sign in with different Google accounts
3. Verify cursors, object sync, real-time collaboration

## Context for Next Session

If I (Cursor AI) return to this project after a memory reset:

1. **Read ALL Memory Bank files first** - this is critical
2. **Check current branch**: `git branch --show-current`
3. **Check git status**: `git status`
4. **Review recent commits**: `git log --oneline -10`
5. **Ask user what they want to work on**
6. **Consult `Tasks.md`** for original plan vs completed work
7. **Consult `progress.md`** for detailed completion status

### Project Is Complete
- All MVP features implemented âœ…
- All acceptance criteria met âœ…  
- Deployed to production âœ…
- Smoke tests passed âœ…
- Documentation comprehensive âœ…

Unless user requests new features or bug fixes, the primary task is complete.
