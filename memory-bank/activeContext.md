## 🚀 What's Next

### PRIORITY 1: AI Canvas Agent (PR15)
**Goal**: Reach 100/100 by adding AI natural language commands  
**Points Available**: 15 points (final requirement)  
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Status**: Not started yet

**What We Need to Build**:
1. Chat interface (sidebar or overlay)
2. AI integration (OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude)
3. Function calling for canvas operations
4. Natural language understanding
5. Context awareness (selected shapes, canvas state)

**Example Commands**:
- "Create 3 red circles"
- "Make all rectangles blue"
- "Align selected shapes horizontally"
- "Delete all text objects"

## 💭 Open Discussions

### Conflict Resolution (Deferred)
**Decision**: Discussed but not implemented yet  
**Reason**: Prioritizing AI features for guaranteed 15 points  
**Options Considered**:
1. Last-Write-Wins (30 mins) - Timestamp-based
2. Object Locking (1 hour) - Lock during edit
3. Conflict Notification (2 hours) - User chooses resolution
4. Operational Transformation (Complex) - Not recommended

**User Preference**: Keep in mind for later, focus on AI first

### Other Deferred Features
- Database persistence (DynamoDB) - After AI
- AWS deployment (EC2 + Redis) - After 100/100 achieved
- Undo/redo functionality - After AI
- Multi-canvas/rooms - After AI

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made (PR10)

### Technology Choices
1. **Konva.js** over native Canvas - Better features, performance
2. **Individual transformers** over group transformer - Better UX
3. **React 19** upgrade - Latest version, Konva compatibility
4. **Node 22 LTS** - Modern features, best compatibility

### UX Decisions
1. **Dashed light blue** selection boxes - Softer, less intrusive
2. **Real-time group drag** - More fluid than snap-on-release
3. **Space for pan** - Industry standard (Figma, Miro)
4. **1px/10px nudging** - Precision + speed options
5. **Zoom to cursor** - Intuitive zoom behavior

### Feature Decisions
1. **12 shapes** - Comprehensive without overwhelming
2. **11 shortcuts** - Professional-grade productivity
3. **Clipboard operations** - Standard workflow support
4. **10%-500% zoom** - Covers all use cases
5. **No conflict resolution yet** - Defer to focus on AI

- **Real-time group drag**: Users love smooth movement
- **Visual toolbar**: Icons make shapes discoverable
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Power users appreciate them

### Challenges Overcome
1. **React 19 compatibility**: Had to upgrade from 18
2. **Node version**: Upgraded from 16 to 22
3. **Type consistency**: Frontend/backend sync issues
4. **WebSocket URL**: Had to force local connection
5. **User names**: Fixed "Development User" issue

### Best Practices Established
1. Always check environment variables
2. Clear Vite cache after type changes
3. Test with 2 browsers for real-time features

2. Chat UI design? (Sidebar vs overlay)
3. Function set? (Which operations to expose)
4. Error handling? (AI misunderstandings)
5. Context passing? (How much state to send)

**Implementation Phases**:
1. Phase 1: Chat UI (1 hour)
2. Phase 2: AI Integration (2 hours)
3. Phase 3: Function Calling (2 hours)
4. Phase 4: Testing & Polish (1 hour)

**Success Criteria**:
- Natural language commands work
- AI understands canvas context
- Operations execute correctly
- Conversational responses
- Error handling graceful

### After AI
1. **Demo Video**: 5-minute walkthrough
2. **Optional Features**: Conflict resolution, persistence
3. **Deployment**: Consider AWS for production
