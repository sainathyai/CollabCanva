Create a formal Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the attached project plan, which describes a large and complex project. Your primary task is to strictly limit the scope of this PRD to only the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) requirements that are achievable within a 24-hour development cycle. You must analyze the source document and extract only the features designated for the MVP, carefully populating a professional PRD structure that includes a brief introduction, clear MVP objectives, and specific user stories with corresponding acceptance criteria. Additionally, incorporate a section with technical stack recommendations suitable for rapid MVP development and propose at least two free-tier authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth or Okta's free plan, that can be implemented quickly. The PRD must also feature a dedicated "Out of Scope" section that explicitly lists all key features from the source document that are being deferred. The final document should be a practical, laser-focused guide for the development team, maintaining the integrity of a formal PRD.
Using this PRD, generate a comprehensive task list that is broken down by individual Pull Requests (PRs), guiding a developer through the entire project for tracking on GitHub. First, define a logical and scalable file structure for the project, listing the key folders and their intended purpose. Following the file structure, create a high-level list of PRs, where each PR represents a distinct and mergeable unit of work. Under each PR, provide a detailed checklist of the specific subtasks required for its completion. Critically, for each individual subtask, you must specify the exact file paths that will be created or edited, ensuring the developer knows precisely where to work. The final output should be a clear, step-by-step roadmap that directly connects project requirements to code implementation on a file-by-file basis.
Analyze the attached development plan, which is organized by PRs and subtasks, and intelligently inject testing tasks where they are most critical. You must avoid a blanket approach; instead, focus on identifying and adding unit and integration tests only for high-value areas such as core business logic, user input validation, API contract enforcement, and authentication or authorization flows. For each relevant PR in the plan, update its subtask checklist to include these new testing tasks, prefixing them with a label like "Test:" for clarity. If a PR's scope changes significantly due to testing, you may restructure it. The final output should be the original plan, thoughtfully updated with a lean but effective testing strategy that ensures stability without adding unnecessary overhead.
Using this context, Generate a Mermaid script for an architectural diagram using graph TD (Top Down) syntax, based on the attached Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the Tasks.md file. The diagram must illustrate the application's high-level architecture, showing the main components of the codebase, such as the Frontend Client and Backend API, as detailed in the task file. Your diagram should clearly map out the key client-server interactions, like API requests for data and user authentication, and include distinct nodes for external technologies mentioned, such as the database and any third-party authentication services. The final output should be only the Mermaid script enclosed in a single Markdown code block, ready to be rendered into a visual diagram.
