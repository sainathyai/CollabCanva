# Rule: Linear Issue Management

## Purpose

Automatically configure and use correct Linear project and team settings for this workspace.

## First-Time Setup (Self-Configuring)

**When creating a Linear issue for the first time in this workspace**, OR when user says **"initiate linear issue rule"** or **"setup linear config"**, the AI MUST:

1. **Check for configuration file**: `.cursor/linear-config.md`
2. **If file does NOT exist**, prompt the user:
   ```
   ðŸ”§ Linear Configuration Setup
   
   I need to configure Linear defaults for this workspace.
   
   Please provide:
   1. Default Team (e.g., "Gauntlet AI", "Engineering")
   2. Default Project (e.g., "gauntletai.com", "Backend API")
   3. Default Assignee (e.g., "Zac Smith", "me")
   
   Or type "auto" to fetch available options from Linear.
   ```

3. **Fetch Linear metadata** (if user types "auto"):
   - Use `mcp_Linear_list_teams` to show available teams
   - Use `mcp_Linear_list_projects` to show available projects
   - Use `mcp_Linear_list_users` to show available users
   - Present options to user for selection

4. **Create configuration file** at `.cursor/linear-config.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Linear Configuration for [Workspace Name]
   
   **Last Updated**: [Date]
   **Workspace**: [Path]
   
   ## Defaults
   
   - **Team**: [Team Name]
   - **Project**: [Project Name]
   - **Assignee**: [User Name]
   
   ## Notes
   
   This configuration is automatically used when creating Linear issues.
   To change defaults, edit this file or delete it to reconfigure.
   ```

5. **Save configuration** and proceed with issue creation

## Normal Operation (After Configuration)

When creating Linear issues:

1. **Read configuration** from `.cursor/linear-config.md`
2. **Apply defaults automatically**:
   - Team: Use configured default team
   - Project: Use configured default project (unless user specifies different)
   - Assignee: Use configured default assignee (unless user specifies different)

3. **Allow overrides**: If user explicitly mentions a different project, team, or assignee, use that instead

## Configuration File Location

```
.cursor/linear-config.md
```

Single file, simple format, easy to edit manually or regenerate.

## Issue Creation Standards

1. **Always include**:
   - Clear title
   - Detailed description
   - Assignee (default or specified)
   - Project (default or specified)
   - Team (default or specified)

2. **Optional fields**:
   - Priority (only if user specifies)
   - Due date (only if user specifies)
   - Labels (only if user specifies)
   - State (defaults to "Todo" unless specified)

## Examples

### First Time (No Config):
```
User: "Create a Linear task for fixing the footer bug"
AI: "ðŸ”§ I need to configure Linear defaults first.
     What team should I use? Type 'auto' to see options."
User: "auto"
AI: [Shows teams: "Gauntlet AI", "CodeShock"]
User: "Gauntlet AI"
AI: [Shows projects in Gauntlet AI team]
User: "gauntletai.com"
AI: [Creates config, then creates issue]
```

### After Configuration:
```
User: "Create a Linear task for the API endpoint"
AI: [Reads config, uses "Gauntlet AI" team and "gauntletai.com" project]
    [Creates issue automatically]
```

### With Override:
```
User: "Create a Linear task for HQ project about dashboard"
AI: [Reads config for team/assignee, but uses "HQ" project instead]
    [Creates issue with override]
```

## Manual Setup Trigger

You can manually trigger the setup process at any time by saying:
- **"initiate linear issue rule"**
- **"setup linear config"**
- **"configure linear defaults"**

This will run the setup even if a config file already exists (allowing you to reconfigure).

## Reconfiguration

To reconfigure:
1. Delete `.cursor/linear-config.md`
2. Next Linear operation will trigger setup again

OR

1. Manually edit `.cursor/linear-config.md`
2. Changes take effect immediately

OR

1. Say **"initiate linear issue rule"** to run setup wizard again

## No Maintenance Required

This is a simple, static configuration. No weekly updates, no complex file structures, just one config file with defaults.
