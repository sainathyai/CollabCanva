## New PR Sequence

```

## Rationale

### Why Reprioritize?

**Points Impact**:
- AI Features (PR11): **+15 points ‚Üí 100/100**
- Layer Panel (PR12): **0 points** (nice-to-have)

**Time Efficiency**:
- Path to 100/100: **4-6 hours** (just PR11)
- With layer panel first: **6-9 hours** (PR11 + PR12)

**Clean GitHub History**:
- PR10: Canvas Foundation
- PR11: AI Features (final requirement)
- PR12+: Polish and extras
