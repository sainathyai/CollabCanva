# Collaborator Management UI Implementation

## Overview
Added a complete collaborator management UI to the Dashboard page, allowing project owners to share their projects with collaborators via email. The dashboard now features a sectioned layout with horizontal scrolling and navigation arrows.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Collaborator Management Modal
- **Location:** Dashboard page
- **Trigger:** "Access" button on project cards (owner only)
- **Functionality:**
  - Add collaborators by email with validation
  - Remove collaborators with confirmation
  - View all people with access (owner + collaborators)
  - Visual distinction between owner and collaborators
  - Real-time error feedback
  - Responsive design

### 2. Visual Indicators on Project Cards
- **"Collaborator" badge:** Purple badge shown on projects where the current user is a collaborator
- **"Shared with X" badge:** Blue badge showing the number of collaborators (shown for all shared projects)
- **Role-based actions:**
  - Owners: Can manage access, edit, and delete
  - Collaborators: Can edit and open (no delete or access management)

### 3. Sectioned Dashboard Layout
- **"My Projects" Section:**
  - Shows projects where user is the owner
  - Includes "New Project" card at the end
  - Horizontal scrolling with navigation arrows
- **"Collaborative Projects" Section:**
  - Shows projects where user is a collaborator
  - Only displayed if user has collaborative projects
  - Same horizontal scrolling navigation

### 4. Horizontal Navigation
- **Left/Right arrow buttons:**
  - Positioned next to section titles
  - Disabled/styled when can't scroll further
  - Smooth scrolling animation
  - Updates dynamically on scroll/resize
- **Hidden scrollbar** for clean UI
- **Touch-friendly** scrolling on mobile

## Components Modified

### `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- Added collaborator state management
- Added `handleManageCollaborators`, `handleAddCollaborator`, `handleRemoveCollaborator` functions
- Created `ProjectSection` component with horizontal scrolling
- Updated `ProjectCard` to show badges and conditional actions
- Added collaborator management modal UI
- Split projects into "My Projects" and "Collaborative Projects"

## API Functions Used
- `addCollaborator(projectId, userId, email)` - Add a collaborator to a project
- `removeCollaborator(projectId, userId, email)` - Remove a collaborator from a project

## User Experience Flow

### Adding a Collaborator
1. Click "Access" button on a project card (owner only)
2. Modal opens showing current access list
3. Enter collaborator's email in the input field
4. Click "Add" button
5. Collaborator is added to the list
6. They can now see and access the project in their "Collaborative Projects" section

### Removing a Collaborator
1. Open "Manage Access" modal
2. Find collaborator in the list
3. Click "Remove" button
4. Confirm removal
5. Collaborator loses access to the project

### Navigating Projects
1. View "My Projects" and "Collaborative Projects" sections
2. Use left/right arrow buttons to scroll through projects
3. Or manually scroll the project list
4. Click "Open Project" to work on any project

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme
- **Owner badge:** Blue gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
- **Collaborator badge:** Purple (#7c3aed on #f3e8ff background)
- **Shared badge:** Blue (#2563eb on #dbeafe background)
- **Access button:** Purple (#7c3aed with #f3e8ff hover)

### Layout
- **Card width:** 280px fixed for consistent horizontal scrolling
- **Gap:** 1.5rem between cards
- **Section spacing:** 3rem between sections
- **Navigation arrows:** 2.5rem circular buttons

## Access Control
- ✅ Only owners can manage collaborators
- ✅ Only owners can delete projects
- ✅ Collaborators can edit project details
- ✅ Collaborators can open and work on projects
- ✅ Backend validates ownership for sensitive operations

## Error Handling
- Email validation (regex check)
- Duplicate collaborator prevention
- Failed API call feedback
- Clear error messages displayed in modal

## Responsive Behavior
- Modal adapts to screen size (max 90vh height, scrollable)
- Horizontal scrolling works on touch devices
- Arrow buttons update on window resize
- Section titles remain visible while scrolling

## Backend Integration
The UI integrates with the existing backend collaborator system:
- `POST /api/projects/:id/collaborators` - Add collaborator
- `DELETE /api/projects/:id/collaborators/:email` - Remove collaborator
- `GET /api/projects` - Returns owned + collaborative projects
- WebSocket authentication checks for owner/collaborator access

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Add Collaborator:**
   - Valid email
   - Invalid email format
   - Duplicate email
   - Non-existent user

2. **Remove Collaborator:**
   - Successful removal
   - Project updates in real-time

3. **Access Control:**
   - Collaborators can't see "Access" button
   - Collaborators can't delete projects
   - Only owners see owner-specific actions

4. **Navigation:**
   - Scroll with arrows
   - Scroll manually
   - Arrow states update correctly
   - Works on mobile touch

5. **Visual Indicators:**
   - Badges show correctly
   - Role detection works
   - Shared count is accurate

## Future Enhancements
- Search for collaborators by name (not just email)
- Role-based permissions (viewer vs. editor)
- Invitation system with notifications
- Activity log showing who made changes
- Batch add multiple collaborators
- Export/share project link
