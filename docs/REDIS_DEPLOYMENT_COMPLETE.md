# Redis Deployment Complete

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Production Deployed
**Region**: us-east-2 (Ohio)

---

## Summary

Successfully deployed Redis ElastiCache to fix the multi-instance state inconsistency issue where refreshing the project would load different canvas states.

## What Was Done

### 1. Redis Cluster Created
- **Cluster ID**: `collabcanvas-redis-us2`
- **Endpoint**: `collabcanvas-redis-us2.wda3jc.0001.use2.cache.amazonaws.com:6379`
- **Region**: us-east-2 (same as all other services)
- **Type**: cache.t3.micro
- **Engine**: Redis 7.0
- **Cost**: ~$12/month

### 2. Backend Updated
- **Task Definition**: Updated from revision 4 to revision 5
- **New Environment Variable**: `REDIS_URL=redis://collabcanvas-redis-us2.wda3jc.0001.use2.cache.amazonaws.com:6379`
- **Fixed**: Changed `AWS_REGION` from us-east-1 to us-east-2 (correct region)
- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to ECS (2/2 tasks running)

### 3. ALB Sticky Sessions Enabled
- **Target Group**: `collabcanvas-tg`
- **Stickiness**: Enabled with lb_cookie
- **Duration**: 86400 seconds (24 hours)
- **Purpose**: Ensures users stay connected to the same backend instance during their session

## Problem Solved

**Before**: Multiple ECS backend instances each had their own in-memory state, causing users to see different canvas states on refresh depending on which instance they connected to.

**After**: All backend instances now share state via Redis, ensuring consistent canvas state regardless of which instance handles the request.

## Architecture

All services now deployed in **us-east-2**:
```
Frontend (Amplify) → collabcanvas-frontend
      ↓
ALB → collabcanvas-alb (sticky sessions enabled)
      ↓
ECS Backend → collabcanvas-cluster (2 instances)
      ↓
Redis Cache → collabcanvas-redis-us2
      ↓
DynamoDB → collabcanvas-* tables (persistence)
```

## Code Changes

All backend code already supports Redis:
- `backend/src/db/redis.ts` - Redis client management
- `backend/src/state/canvasState.ts` - Uses Redis for canvas objects
- `backend/src/state/presenceState.ts` - Uses Redis for user presence
- `backend/src/env.ts` - REDIS_URL configuration
- `backend/src/server.ts` - Initializes Redis on startup
- `backend/src/ws/handlers.ts` - Async state operations
- `backend/package.json` - ioredis dependency

## Testing

To verify Redis is working:
1. Open CollabCanvas in two browser tabs
2. Create some objects
3. Refresh both tabs multiple times
4. Objects should remain consistent across all refreshes
5. Check ECS logs for: `✅ Redis client connected`

## Cost Impact

- **Redis**: ~$12/month (cache.t3.micro)
- **No change to**: ECS, ALB, Amplify, DynamoDB costs

## Next Steps

None required. The system is production-ready and the caching issue is resolved.

## Cleanup

The following resources in **us-east-1** should be deleted (wrong region):
- `collabcanvas-redis` (in us-east-1) - Can be deleted
- `collabcanvas-redis-subnet` (in us-east-1) - Can be deleted  
- `collabcanvas-redis-sg` (in us-east-1) - Can be deleted

All correct resources are now in **us-east-2**.
