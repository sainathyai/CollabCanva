# CollabCanvas Production - Task Index

**Strategy**: PR-by-PR development with continuous testing
**AWS Deployment**: Deferred until all features working locally
**Testing**: Every task includes immediate verification

---

## Development Workflow

1. **Work on one PR at a time**
2. **Test every task immediately** (don't accumulate untested code)
3. **Fix issues before moving to next task**
4. **Merge PR when Definition of Done is met**
5. **Start next PR**

## Testing Philosophy

**Test immediately after every task:**
- Don't accumulate untested code
- Fix issues right away
- Verify real-time sync with 2 browsers
- Check console for errors
- Confirm TypeScript compiles

**If test fails:**
- Stop and debug
- Don't proceed to next task
- Don't merge PR with failing tests

**When PR complete:**
- Run full End-to-End test suite
- Check "Definition of Done"
- Merge to main
- Start next PR

---

## Notes

- **No timelines** - focus on quality and testing
- **AWS deployment** - defer until features complete locally
- **Aggressive development** - move fast but test continuously
- **PR-by-PR** - complete one PR fully before starting next
