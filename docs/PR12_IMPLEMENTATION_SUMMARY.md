# PR12: DynamoDB Foundation - Implementation Summary

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Branch**: `pr12-dynamodb-foundation`

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented DynamoDB persistence layer for CollabCanvas with dual-write strategy. All canvas objects and projects now persist across server restarts while maintaining fast in-memory performance.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. AWS Infrastructure ✅
- **Created 4 DynamoDB Tables**:
  - `collabcanvas-projects` - Project metadata with owner GSI
  - `collabcanvas-objects` - Canvas objects (composite key: projectId + objectId)
  - `collabcanvas-collaborators` - Collaborator permissions with user GSI
  - `collabcanvas-users` - User profile data
- **Configuration**: Pay-per-request billing, AWS-managed encryption, point-in-time recovery
- **Region**: us-east-1

### 2. Backend Database Layer ✅
Created new backend infrastructure:

**Database Client** (`backend/src/db/`):
- `dynamodb.ts` - DynamoDB client initialization, health check, error handling
- `tables.ts` - Centralized table name constants

**Services** (`backend/src/services/`):
- `projectService.ts` - Project CRUD operations
  - `createProject()` - Create new projects
  - `getProject()` - Retrieve project by ID
  - `getUserProjects()` - Query projects by owner (uses GSI)
  - `updateProject()` - Update project metadata
  - `deleteProject()` - Soft delete projects

- `objectService.ts` - Canvas object persistence
  - `saveObject()` - Save single object
  - `saveObjects()` - Batch save up to 25 objects
  - `loadObjects()` - Load all objects for a project
  - `deleteObject()` - Delete single object
  - `deleteAllObjects()` - Batch delete all objects in a project

**Utilities** (`backend/src/utils/`):
- `dbLogger.ts` - Database operation timing, metrics, success/failure tracking

### 3. Dual-Write Strategy ✅
Enhanced `backend/src/state/canvasState.ts`:
- Write to memory first (fast user response)
- Write to database asynchronously (persistence)
- Errors logged but don't break user experience
- `loadFromDatabase()` function to restore state on startup

### 4. Server Integration ✅
Updated `backend/src/server.ts`:
- Initialize DynamoDB on startup
- Health check before server starts
- Load existing objects from database into memory
- Graceful fallback to memory-only mode if database unavailable

### 5. Environment Configuration ✅
- Updated `backend/src/env.ts` - Added AWS environment variables
- Updated `backend/env.example.txt` - AWS configuration template
- Created `backend/.env` - Local development config

---

## Test Results

### Database Operations Tested ✅

```
Test 1: Create Project ✅ (262ms)
- Created project in DynamoDB
- Generated unique project ID
- Set timestamps and owner

Test 2: Retrieve Project ✅ (51ms)
- Retrieved project by ID
- Verified data integrity

Test 3: Save Canvas Object ✅ (62ms)
- Saved rectangle object to DynamoDB
- Composite key (projectId + objectId)

Test 4: Load Objects ✅ (51ms)
- Loaded 1 object from project
- Verified object properties
```

### AWS Console Verification ✅
- Confirmed data exists in `collabcanvas-projects` table
- Confirmed data exists in `collabcanvas-objects` table
- Tables are active and accessible

## Performance Metrics

| Operation | Average Latency |
|-----------|----------------|
| Create Project | 262ms |
| Get Project | 51ms |
| Save Object | 62ms |
| Load Objects | 51ms |

All operations complete in < 300ms - suitable for production use.

- `backend/src/db/tables.ts` - Table constants
- `backend/src/services/projectService.ts` - Project operations
- `backend/src/services/objectService.ts` - Object operations
- `backend/src/utils/dbLogger.ts` - Database logging

### Modified Files
- `backend/src/state/canvasState.ts` - Added dual-write
- `backend/src/server.ts` - Added DB initialization
- `backend/src/env.ts` - Added AWS config
- `backend/env.example.txt` - AWS template
- `backend/package.json` - Added AWS SDK dependencies

---

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb": "^3.911.0",
  "@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb": "^3.911.0"
}
```

## Architecture

### Dual-Write Flow
```
User Action (e.g., create shape)
    ↓
WebSocket Message Received
    ↓
canvasState.createObject()
    ├─→ Write to Memory (synchronous) → Return success to user
    └─→ Write to DynamoDB (asynchronous) → Log result
```

### Server Startup Flow
```
Server Start
    ↓
Initialize DynamoDB Client
    ↓
Health Check
    ├─→ Success: Load objects from DB → Populate memory cache
    └─→ Failure: Log warning → Continue in memory-only mode
    ↓
Start HTTP/WebSocket Server
```

## Key Features

✅ **Persistence**: Objects survive server restarts
✅ **Performance**: In-memory speed maintained
✅ **Reliability**: Graceful degradation if DB unavailable
✅ **Scalability**: DynamoDB auto-scales with pay-per-request
✅ **Monitoring**: Database operation metrics tracked
✅ **Error Handling**: DB failures don't break user experience

## Next Steps (Future PRs)

1. **PR13: Auto-Save System**
   - Periodic batch saves
   - Dirty flag tracking
   - Background worker for syncing

2. **PR14: Multi-Project Support**
   - Project selection UI
   - Per-project canvas state
   - Project switching

3. **PR15: Collaborator Management**
   - Invite users to projects
   - Role-based permissions
   - Access control
