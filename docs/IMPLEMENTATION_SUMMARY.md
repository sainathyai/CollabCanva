**Last Updated**: October 16, 2025  
**Current Branch**: `pr11-ai-canvas-agent`  
**Next Branch**: `pr12-dynamodb-foundation`

---

## üéØ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Features (PR1-PR11):

**Core Canvas Functionality**:
- Real-time collaborative canvas with WebSockets

- Drag, resize, rotate transformations
- Multi-select with drag-to-select
- Copy, paste, duplicate operations
- Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts
- Grid overlay with toggle
- Zoom and pan controls
- Fit All function

**AI Features (PR11)**:

## üöß Known Limitations (Why We Need DB)

### Current Architecture Issues:

**1. Data Loss**:
- All canvas objects stored in backend memory
- Server restart = complete data loss
- No persistence whatsoever
- Users lose all work

**2. Single Canvas**:
- All users share one global canvas
- No project isolation
- Can't organize work
- No privacy

**3. Scaling Issues**:
- Can't run multiple backend containers
- Each container has separate memory
- WebSocket connections tied to single container
- Limited to vertical scaling only

**4. No Collaboration**:
- Can't invite specific people to projects
- No access control
- Everyone can edit everything
- No role-based permissions

## üéØ Solution: DynamoDB + Redis Architecture

### Why This Combo?

**DynamoDB** = Persistence (Survives crashes, unlimited storage)  
**Redis** = Speed (Sub-5ms reads, real-time pub/sub)  
**Together** = Fast + Reliable

### How It Works:

```
User Action (Create Object)
  ‚Üì
Backend receives WebSocket message
  ‚Üì
Write to Redis immediately (1-2ms) ‚Üê User sees instant feedback
  ‚Üì
Mark project as "dirty"
  ‚Üì
Background worker saves to DynamoDB (5 seconds later)
  ‚Üì
Data safely persisted forever
```

### Benefits:

**For Users**:
- ‚úÖ Instant response times (< 5ms)
- ‚úÖ Never lose work (persisted forever)
- ‚úÖ Create unlimited projects
- ‚úÖ Invite collaborators
- ‚úÖ Work continues during server restarts

**For System**:
- ‚úÖ Horizontal scaling (multiple containers)
- ‚úÖ High availability (redundancy)
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective ($35/month for 1000 users)
- ‚úÖ Production-ready architecture

## üéì Key Decisions

### Why DynamoDB?
- Scales automatically
- Pay-per-request pricing
- No server management
- Perfect for our access patterns
- AWS native integration

### Why Redis?
- Extremely fast (< 5ms)
- Built-in pub/sub
- Atomic operations
- Session management
- Great for presence tracking

### Why Not Just One?
- DynamoDB alone = slower (10-15ms)
- Redis alone = not persistent (loses data)
- Together = best of both worlds

### Why Not PostgreSQL?
- Need to manage servers
- Fixed capacity planning
- Higher costs
- More complex scaling
- Overkill for this use case
