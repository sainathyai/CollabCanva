### Summary

Ash Tilawat outlined the mandatory submission requirements, including a public GitHub repository, a 3-5 minute walkthrough video demonstrating MVP features, a deployed application link, and a one-page AI development log detailing prompts and thought processes. Ash clarified the purpose and content of the AI development log for Francisco dG, Justice Perez White, and Nick Blaskovich, and emphasized the importance of high-quality prompts for efficient AI code generation, as reinforced by Max Efremov and Davi Caetano. Ash also advised scheduled cleanup sessions and leveraging AI for slop detection, as discussed with Kiran Rushton and Francisco dG, and stressed the critical importance of submitting something by the deadline to avoid program removal.

### Details

* **Submission Requirements** Ash Tilawat detailed the mandatory components for every submission, which include a GitHub repository link (public for most projects, private with temporary access for sensitive ones like capstones), a walkthrough video explaining the codebase and architecture but focusing only on MVP features, a deployed link to the application, and an AI development log ([00:00:00](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.ue5am6t8vqu7)). The AI development log is a one-page document outlining prompts, processes, and thought processes used during coding. A social post about progress or learning, aimed at building a personal brand, is also required ([00:01:57](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.1ntmncbpdep0)).

* **Video Content and Purpose** Ash Tilawat clarified that the walkthrough video should showcase MVP features working, such as cursors, names on cursors, shape creation, and double browsers, rather than a line-by-line code explanation ([00:02:51](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.unkpznb3mauw)). Francisco dG confirmed that the video is for testing features, and Ash emphasized that videos submitted before the final Sunday submission are solely for grading staff, while the final Sunday video is public and for hiring partners and portfolios ([00:03:46](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.yl60n7jnv1s9)). Myles Lewis reinforced that the video needs to demonstrate features and overall code architecture, not a detailed breakdown of every file ([00:06:01](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.4naqm6mxa8l9)).

* **Feature Order and Cleanup** Ash Tilawat stated that the order of adding MVP features does not matter, although for the AI agent to be built later, some underlying Figma features are necessary ([00:06:01](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.4naqm6mxa8l9)). Kiran Rushton asked about prioritizing cleanup over sprinting to the finish line, and Ash recommended scheduled cleanups of about an hour throughout the week to break up large files, remove dead code, and understand project components ([00:20:22](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.j39fsw1670bj)).

* **Brain Lift and Memory Bank** Ash Tilawat explained that the brain lift and memory bank are not required for today's submission. They clarified that the AI development log is for documenting the MVP build process, and the brain lift is a different methodology for staying at the frontier of AI, while the memory bank is an AI-first development technique ([00:06:57](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.mk5hv65qu21i)).

* **AI Development Log Content** Francisco dG inquired about the content of the one-page AI development log, specifically whether it should include only the most recent process or cover restarts and roadblocks. Ash Tilawat confirmed that either the most recent process or portions of all processes are acceptable, as long as the log demonstrates the developer's thinking and learning from the process ([00:07:56](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.15807sm7xnu5)). Justice Perez White received confirmation that they could recreate their AI log based on their methodology and chat history, as it doesn't need to be perfect ([00:14:29](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.2k2nuzhbd2wd)). Nick Blaskovich also confirmed that a general flow explanation of their AI interaction, such as starting with Claude to create a task list, is acceptable for the log ([00:33:52](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.4vbypkziey3t)).

* **Video Length and Grading Process** Ash Tilawat advised that the walkthrough video should be three to five minutes long, as they will first watch the video, then verify features on the deployed link, and finally review the code for "AI slop" or poorly organized files ([00:09:00](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.mq0bw2p9jg8o)). They noted that while some slop is acceptable, multiple files over a thousand lines would be a red flag ([00:09:51](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.oy9axzfkrzhc)).

* **Leveraging AI for Code Generation and Learning** Max Efremov shared that the MVP project can be "one-shotted" by AI with one or two prompts if the PRD and task list are well-structured ([00:14:29](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.2k2nuzhbd2wd)). Ash Tilawat supported this, stating that the gauntlet aims to break preconceived notions of AI capabilities by demonstrating its ability to handle repetitive coding tasks and achieve 80-90% completion if given a clear recipe ([00:18:02](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.lyhuw7vgg6wt)). Brian Smith added that AI tools like Cursor can explain codebases and create learning paths, which was a significant takeaway for them ([00:26:40](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.exfry2penjai)).

* **Context Engineering and Prompt Quality** Ash Tilawat emphasized the importance of well-structured prompts, stating that spending five to fifteen minutes on a prompt is better than multiple thoughtless ones, as quality prompts lead to higher accuracy and save time ([00:21:24](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.kq1snborx3p4)). Max Efremov reinforced the idea that providing as much relevant context as possible to the AI at once, making it "one-shottable," is crucial for efficient development ([00:47:29](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.shm07zq3jaaw)). Davi Caetano asked if his binary search approach to prompting was correct, and Ash confirmed that there is no single right or wrong method, as prompting styles differ for everyone ([00:54:10](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.dfwb6eotrc9g)).

* **Understanding the Codebase** Ash Tilawat clarified that when green-fielding a project, developers need to understand less code because they control all new code. They stated that understanding the component structure, directory organization, and data flow is crucial, rather than knowing the inner workings of every UI component or API call ([00:23:44](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.h5qpum1x8ez7)). Ash further explained component architecture as the high-level system design, directory structure as the purpose of each folder, and data flow as mapping user actions to data movement across the application ([00:24:45](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.zd3kxsauiqsi)).

* **AI for Slop Detection** Francisco dG expressed concern about cleaning up "slop" given the focus on AI generation. Ash Tilawat clarified that AI, particularly Gemini 2.5, can efficiently detect and remove dead code, and that developers can use cursor to detect slop within their code or utilize existing libraries for deterministic code analysis ([00:30:25](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.zd7rlgyte91c)) ([00:33:00](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.amq1z1e4q46m)).

* **Submission Importance** Ash Tilawat stressed the critical importance of submitting something by the deadline of 10:59 PM CT tonight, even if it's incomplete, to avoid automatic program removal. They mentioned that two withdrawals have already occurred in the program ([00:36:13](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.r4rb0s4u1ikt)).

* **Debugging with AI** Mark Fuechec raised a bug-fixing issue, and Ash Tilawat suggested using AI to identify functions/components involved, then providing a prescriptive prompt to log the entire data flow from component to database ([00:37:50](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.nfe1gpgj90xs)). By analyzing these logs, the AI can then pinpoint and fix the error ([00:39:48](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.m6a6mtyw576m)). Nick Blaskovich supported this, adding that it can be helpful to tell the AI to stop writing code and discuss the root cause before executing a fix ([00:40:51](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.uppu8xiviffl)).

* **Final Submission Polish** Max Efremov inquired about the purpose of the remaining days after MVP submission, and Ash Tilawat stated that this time should be used to polish the application, add distinguishing features, and make it user-ready for hiring partners ([00:49:53](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.bh8wbkoetvp7)).

* **Task List Updates** Myles Lewis asked about updating the task list for minor changes or bugs missed by AI. Ash Tilawat clarified that updates are necessary only for dramatic changes or if the current task list would completely derail the AI, emphasizing that the task list is primarily for the developer's process and the AI's understanding, not public sharing ([00:51:03](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.tkilnqq75bds)).

* **MVP Grading and Referrals** Momen Mushtaha asked about grading criteria, and Ash Tilawat explained that for tonight, MVP grading is based solely on whether the identified features work; the full rubric for the final submission will be provided tomorrow. William Sutton asked about referrals for hiring partners, and Ash directed them to Brett at Brettglandhq.com, who manages the hiring partnerships side of the company ([00:53:02](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.agnsu9nfmhn6)).

* **Spec Changes and Task Management** Ash Tilawat clarified that significant changes in dependencies, component structure, or context management should drive changes in specifications (specs), not minor task list adjustments ([00:58:00](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.raswnrrbg5uq)). They also advised committing task lists to GitHub for version control and better team task division ([00:59:01](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.chdlv0gqc0n4)).

* **Onboarding and Submission Information** Brian Smith inquired about the source of submission emails, and Ash Tilawat confirmed they would come from a Gauntlet AI domain, either ash@gauntletai.com or rs@gauntletai.com ([00:59:56](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.hoqn0b1wj67v)). Ash also urged participants to watch the "onboarding video and registration" found in the cohort 3 only channel's pinned messages for a comprehensive walkthrough of the onboarding process ([01:00:48](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.8klw6stgavs1)).

* **Upcoming Session Topics and Guest Speakers** Ash Tilawat announced a shift in teaching focus, with tomorrow's session covering tool calling and the following day dedicated to agents ([01:00:48](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.8klw6stgavs1)). They also revealed that Austin would lead a standup and Q\&A session on the program, and Brett, who manages hiring partnerships, would lead a standup and Q\&A on Thursday. Additionally, Aaron Galant, an expert in ML and AI, will be a new instructor leading the tool calling session ([01:01:50](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.y4dyg8rqllk9)).

* **Technical Support and Resources** Johnathan Skeete asked for help with a "network control plane outage" issue on Railway, and Ash Tilawat suggested posting the query in one of the cohort 3 Slack channels for peer assistance or reaching out to Tom Tarpy, their DevOps specialist, for deployment issues ([01:01:50](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.y4dyg8rqllk9)). Ash also previously recommended checking GitHub for template repositories for authentication issues ([00:59:01](?tab=t.uqoiw1a5i6ev#heading=h.chdlv0gqc0n4)).
