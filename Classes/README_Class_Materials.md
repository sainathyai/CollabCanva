## üí° Key Takeaways from Week 1

### Philosophy
1. AI enables 20-30x productivity multiplier
2. Your role shifted from coder to architect/navigator
3. First few weeks: 100% AI-generated code (no manual coding)
4. Crossover point typically happens Week 2-3

### Technical
1. **Three-step planning**: PRD ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Architecture
2. **Memory Bank**: Long-term memory for LLMs across chats
3. **Tool Calling**: Make LLMs reliable for math, data, side effects
4. **Agents**: Use LLMs to select sequence of actions (with caution)

### Practical
1. Plan outside Cursor (save tokens), code inside Cursor
2. Treat AI as fast junior developer
3. Review all AI output‚Äîyou're the senior engineer
4. Deploy early and often
5. Scheduled cleanup sessions prevent code bloat

### Success Metrics
- Can you generate a quality PRD in 30-45 min?
- Do you understand memory bank setup and usage?
- Can you explain when to use tool calling?
- Are you trusting AI more and manually fixing less?
