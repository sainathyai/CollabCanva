## Cohort 3 Kickoff - Program Overview

**Speakers**: Austen Allred (Founder) & Ash Tilawat (Program Director)

### Program Summary

Gauntlet AI is an intensive 10-week program designed to bring participants to the cutting edge of AI-first development. The program selected ~150 participants from nearly 9,000 applicants, emphasizing leveraging AI as a primary tool for coding rather than building new AI models.

## Program Philosophy & Vision

### The Vision Behind Gauntlet AI

Austen Allred founded Gauntlet AI during a unique historical moment where AI's ability to write code emerged as a revolutionary force multiplier. Initial research showed that while 99% of AI applications were hype, the 1% demonstrating AI writing code hinted at **a revolutionary change in productivity**—allowing one person to accomplish what previously required a team of 5-6 people.

### Core Philosophy: AI-First Development

- **What it is**: Leveraging AI as a primary tool rather than building new AI models
- **Goal**: Make participants experts in using various AI models and tools to optimize workflows for different coding and development tasks
- **Mindset shift**: From manual coder to AI navigator and architect

## Program Structure & Requirements

### Time Commitment

- **80-100 hour work weeks** (average often reaching 100 hours)
- This demanding schedule is necessary to reach the cutting edge of AI within an abbreviated timeframe
- Program is not suitable for those who are not fully committed

### Program Phases

#### Phase 1: Remote (First 3 weeks)
- Focus on refining AI-first workflows
- All participants work remotely
- No manual coding allowed—AI must generate 100% of the code initially
- Goal: Reach "crossover point" where AI coding becomes faster than manual coding

#### Phase 2: Austin, Texas (In-person)
- Requires completing challenges and meeting success criteria
- Behavioral interview required
- Proctored CCAT (cognitive assessment) required
- Admission to Austin is NOT guaranteed

### Admission Criteria for Austin

1. Complete all challenges successfully
2. Meet defined success criteria for projects
3. Pass behavioral interview
4. Pass proctored CCAT

   - Clean commits and version control

3. **"Brain Lift" Document (AI Development Log)**
   - One-page document detailing AI-first methodology
   - Include: PRD creation, task lists, document indexing
   - Shows your thinking process and learning

4. **Video Walkthrough (posted to X/Twitter)**
   - 3-5 minutes demonstrating features
   - Architecture overview
   - Mandatory "building in public" exercise
   - Can lead to valuable networking and job opportunities

### Project Progression

- **Week 1**: One project per week
- **Later weeks**: Frequency increases as AI capabilities improve
- Projects focus on two aspects:
  1. **Building with AI**: Speed builds of large applications using AI
  2. **Building AI**: Adding AI features to applications
