## üåü Overview

CollabCanvas is a **real-time collaborative design platform** that enables multiple users to work together on a shared canvas with **AI-powered assistance**. Think Figma meets ChatGPT - design collaboratively while an AI agent helps you create, modify, and organize your designs through natural language.

### üéØ Key Highlights

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit simultaneously with <100ms sync latency
- **AI Canvas Agent**: Natural language commands for creating and manipulating objects
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Owner, Editor, and Viewer roles
- **Multi-Project Dashboard**: Manage multiple canvases with collaborator management
- **Production-Ready**: Deployed on AWS with DynamoDB, ECS Fargate, and Amplify
- **Optimized Performance**: 60 FPS rendering, handles 10,000+ objects with viewport culling

## ‚ú® Features

### üé® Canvas Capabilities

- **Rich Object Creation**: Rectangles, circles, ellipses, triangles, stars, lines, arrows, and text
- **Transform Operations**: Move, resize, rotate, and duplicate objects
- **Multi-Select**: Select and manipulate multiple objects at once
- **Color Customization**: Change object colors dynamically
- **Pan & Zoom**: Navigate large canvases smoothly (0.1x - 10x zoom)
- **Grid System**: Adaptive grid that adjusts based on zoom level
- **Object Virtualization**: Only renders visible objects for optimal performance

### üë• Real-Time Collaboration

- **Live Cursors**: See collaborators' cursors with names in real-time
- **Instant Sync**: Object changes propagate in <100ms

- **Generation**: "Generate 100 random objects"
- **Selection**: "Select all circles"
- **Complex Commands**: Multi-step operations

### üîê Access Control

- **Owner**: Full access - manage project, collaborators, and all objects
- **Editor**: Edit objects but cannot modify project settings
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to view canvas

### üìä Multi-Project Management

- **Dashboard**: View and manage all your projects
- **Project Cards**: Visual preview with collaborator info
- **Access Management**: Add/remove collaborators with specific roles
- **Real-Time Sync**: Automatic canvas state persistence to DynamoDB

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Firebase account (for authentication)
- OpenAI API key (for AI features)
- AWS account (for production deployment)

### Local Development

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sainathyai/CollabCanva.git
cd CollabCanva
```

#### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp env.example.txt .env

# Configure .env with your values:
# - Firebase Admin SDK credentials
# - AWS region and credentials
# - OpenAI API key
```

#### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp env.example.txt .env.local

# Configure .env.local with:

   - SPA rewrites configured for React Router
   - Environment variables configured in Amplify Console

2. **Backend (ECS)**:
   - Dockerized Node.js application
   - Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory
   - Secrets managed via AWS Systems Manager
   - DynamoDB for state persistence

### Quick Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

## ‚ö° Performance

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Code Splitting**: Lazy-loaded routes reduce initial bundle by 76%
2. **Object Virtualization**: Only renders objects in viewport
3. **Adaptive Grid**: Grid complexity reduces when zoomed out
4. **Component Memoization**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders
5. **WebSocket Optimization**: Debounced cursor updates, efficient message format

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Initial Load** | < 3s | 0.8s ‚úÖ |
| **Bundle Size** | < 500 KB | 189 KB ‚úÖ |
| **Object Sync** | < 100ms | ~50ms ‚úÖ |
| **Cursor Sync** | < 50ms | ~20ms ‚úÖ |
| **FPS (60 objects)** | 60 FPS | 60 FPS ‚úÖ |
| **FPS (10,000 objects)** | 30 FPS | 30-60 FPS ‚úÖ |

### Scalability

- **Concurrent Users**: Tested with 10+ simultaneous users
- **Object Capacity**: Handles 10,000+ objects per canvas
- **Canvas Size**: Unlimited (virtualized rendering)
